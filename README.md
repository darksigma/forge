# Forge

We're building a graphical programming language that takes the complexity out of building production scale backends. Although it may take a day or two to design an application's backend, writing the code, provisioning infrastructure, and deploying can take weeks of time. Our goal was to create a technology that helps developers take their whiteboard flow diagrams and turn them into highly available and scalable backends that are seamlessly deployed as they are being designed. Forge is our solution to this pervasive challenge
